// standard comments

/*
 * Multiline comments
 */

// similar to C/C++ end lines with ';' and code blocks in {}

{
    // This is a code block, with a comment and two statements
    const name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
    alert(name);
}

// whitespace is basically ignored in js

// all primitive types:
// strings, numbers, bools, symbol, bigint, undefined

// const sets variable to constant
// let allows mutability
// var is generic catch all

// undefined is what it says it is

// variable names can start with $, _, or [a-zA-Z]
